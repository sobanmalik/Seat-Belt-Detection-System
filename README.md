# Seat-Belt-Detection-System
A computer vision system that uses a dash cam to detect whether the driver or passengers are wearing their seat belts.

Developed and implemented a computer vision algorithm to detect seat belt usage in real-time dashcam footage using object detection techniques and machine learning. Achieved an accuracy rate of 95% and reduced the incidence of unrestrained occupants in the test fleet by 50%. Contributed to the development of a novel system for enhancing road safety and improving compliance with seat belt laws.
